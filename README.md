"Christofides Algorithm" 
The .cpp files contain working code for every part of the algorithm except for computing a minimum-weight perfect matching. There is an implementation but it does not really work -- only for very small inputs.

Inside the Mini Scratch folder is a full working implmentation of Christofides' algorithm, where we have taken the code for finding a minimum-weight perfect matching from a library. We have also rewritten our implementations of MST, Eulerian cycle, etc. in Java there. 

If one happens to implement a simple perfect matching c++ implementation pull requests are appreciated. 
We used Concorde to compute exact TSP solutions.
Some of the cases inside TEST are taken from websites like

Other websites like https://neos-server.org/neos/solvers/co:concorde/TSP.html can prove helpful when looking for TSP solutions.
